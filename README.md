## How to run locally 
explain detailed steps to run your project locally , example to run a react application 
- step 1 : open terminal
- step 2 : cd backend
- step 3 :  npm i
            nodemon server.js
- step 4 : in backend  create file .env
- step 5 : paste this in that file
	   PORT=3000
	   MONGO_DB_URI=mongodb+srv://thanush:thanush@cluster0.li74ndu.mongodb.net/?retryWrites=true&w=majority&appName=Cluster0
	   JWT_SECRET=thanush
 	   NODE_ENV=development
- step 6 : cd frontend
           npm i
           npm run dev
